FreeCodeCamp.org Projects and Info.

9-20-2022:
Currently working on the Information Security Certification. (300hrs)

    I'm writing the code and solving the problems on Replit:
        https://boilerplate-infosec-1.marduk-james.repl.co
    Seemed easier to get credit for the completed tasks.  I will keep a repository here as well to help keep notes and examples.




Ongoing:
I will keep adding my previously completed tasks and examples from previous certifications that I've earned.
